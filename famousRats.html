            First on this list, this famous rat is no one to mess with. Splinter, the famous martial arts master turned to a rat via a radioactive substance who later would raise 4 beautiful boys, is the star of the TMNT franchise. Even though his boys get more screen time he is the obvious star. With the skills to both teach and kick ass he was an easy contender to have on this epic list.

        <div class="text">
            Sliding down the sewers to our fourth spot is Sid, the leading act of the box office hit flushed away. His famous appearance in the flushed away movie made this contender even easier, but even without the movie credit his wits, smarts and outstanding fashion sense puts him in one of our favorites.

            He might control us via our hair to put him in this spot, Remy from the niche indie movie Ratatouille. Even though being the villain in the movie, he is sure to blow us away with his mind control tricks. His power even outmatches Splinter. His backstory of coming from the slums of Paris to take over the world makes this one easy contender. Fun fact he can cook.

            He truly stole our heart, the pizza stealing rat. The conniving little rat that became world famous after one amazing clip was hard not to put in the first spot. Now a famous youtuber is storming the world. But because of his recent allegations against women in the industry we canâ€™t put him in the spotlight. Even though the allegations seeming very real, we dont believe them because this rat stole our hearts (awww)
